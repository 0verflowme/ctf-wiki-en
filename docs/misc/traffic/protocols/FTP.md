### FTP



FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is one of the protocols in the TCP/IP Protocol group. The FTP protocol consists of two parts, the FTP server, and the FTP client. The FTP server is used to store the files, and the user can use the FTP client to access the resources located on the FTP server through the FTP protocol. When developing a website, the FTP protocol is usually used to upload web pages or programs to the Web server. In addition, because the FTP transfer rate is quite fast, itâ€™s commonly used for transferring large files over the network.



By default, the FTP protocol uses TCP ports 20 and 21. Port 20 is for transmitting data, and port 21 for transmitting commands. However, the data transfer port depends on the transfer mode used by FTP. If active mode is used, then the data transfer port is 20 used. If passive mode is enabled, the specific port used can be decided by the server and the client.
