A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design.

Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.
